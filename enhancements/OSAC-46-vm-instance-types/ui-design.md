# VM Instance Types UI

## Summary

This design adds a Cloud Provider Admin UI for the existing `InstanceType`
backend API. It builds on the backend instance-types proposal already defined
under [OSAC-46](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-46) and implemented
under [OSAC-1205](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-1205). No proto or
backend changes are part of this work.

This phase is intentionally narrow: it is only for the cloud provider admin
experience. Tenant-facing instance type selection and display already exist and
are out of scope here.

## Scope

In scope:

- A provider-only instance type list page.
- A provider-only create flow for new instance types.
- Lifecycle state management from the list page using predefined row actions.
- Use of the existing private `InstanceTypes` API from `osac-ui`.

Out of scope:

- Tenant-facing UX changes.
- GPU-related instance type fields. UI design for that work will be added
  alongside
  [the OSAC-2917 GPU instance types PRD](https://github.com/osac-project/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/enhancements/OSAC-2917-gpu-instance-types/prd.md).

## Proposal

Add a new provider-admin UI surface in `osac-ui` for `InstanceType`
management.

### Navigation and Routing

- Add a new `Infrastructure` nav item under the admin area.
- Add a new `Instance Types` nav item under `Infrastructure`.
- Add admin routes for:
  - `/admin/infrastructure/instance-types` for the list page
  - `/admin/infrastructure/instance-types/create` for the create page

### List Page

- Add a list page that shows existing instance types with basic columns:
  name, cores, memory (GiB), description, and `Lifecycle State`.
- If fetching instance types fails, show the same non-loading error state used
  by other list pages.
- Distinguish a failed `useAdminInstanceTypes` request from a successful empty
  result; the latter remains the normal empty state.
- The `Lifecycle State` column should use the same visual treatment as
  ClusterVersions: `ACTIVE` in green, `DEPRECATED` in orange, and `OBSOLETE` in
  grey.

### Create Page

- Add a create page with fields for name, description, CPU cores, and Memory
  (GiB). `cores` and `memory_gib` should be required integer values greater
  than zero.
- The create form should follow the existing wizard interaction pattern:
  submit remains enabled, and clicking submit surfaces validation errors from
  the schema instead of pre-emptively disabling the action.
- The validation schema should reject decimal values for `cores` and
  `memory_gib`, not just zero or negative numbers.

### Lifecycle Actions

- Add table row actions for lifecycle management using the same approach as the
  ClusterVersion design: `Deprecate`, `Obsolete`, and `Reactivate`.
- Add a `Delete` row action that is available only when the current instance
  type state is `OBSOLETE`.
- Compute available lifecycle actions from the current backend state. For
  example, an `OBSOLETE` instance type offers `Reactivate`, `Deprecate`, and
  `Delete`, but not `Obsolete`.

This design does not add a general edit form for lifecycle metadata. State
transitions happen through explicit row actions, while timestamps remain
system-managed by the backend.

This design also does not add a details page. `InstanceType` currently has no
conditions or additional read-only detail data that would provide value beyond
the list and create flows in this phase.

Delete is not available for `ACTIVE` or `DEPRECATED` instance types. After the
item reaches `OBSOLETE`, the list page should enable a `Delete` row action for
final cleanup.

## Field naming

- `metadata.name` -> Name
- `spec.description` -> Description
- `spec.cores` -> CPU cores
- `spec.memory_gib` -> Memory (GiB)

## Implementation details

- **Name field**: use the shared `NameField` for `metadata.name`. `InstanceType`
reuses the common backend `Metadata.name` validation (RFC 1035 DNS-label
restrictions) — the same validation that already backs `NameField` for
resources such as `ComputeInstance`, so no new field component is needed.

- **Numeric fields**: use the shared `InputField` with `type="number"` for
`spec.cores` and `spec.memory_gib`, with `step=1`. After schema validation,
convert those values to integers before constructing the API request body.

- **API hooks**: add `libs/ui-components/src/api/v1/private/instance-type.ts`,
following the existing `private/tenant.ts` pattern (private `InstanceTypes`
client from `@osac/types/private`) together with the update-mask pattern
already used by `usePatchComputeInstance` in `compute-instance.ts`. Register a
new `'v1/private/instance_types'` entry in `ApiRoute`
(`libs/ui-components/src/api/types.ts`) first. Hooks needed:
  - `useAdminInstanceTypes` — list, via the private client, returning all
    lifecycle states. The codebase already has a tenant-facing
    `useInstanceTypes` in `v1/instance-types.ts`, so the provider/admin flow
    should use a distinct hook name rather than introducing a second
    `useInstanceTypes`.
  - `useCreateInstanceType` — create mutation for the create page, invalidating
    the list query on success (same shape as `useCreateTenant`).
  - `useUpdateInstanceTypeState` — one mutation hook parameterized by a
    `InstanceTypeLifecycleAction = 'deprecate' | 'obsolete' | 'reactivate'`
    input, mirroring how `usePatchComputeInstance` is parameterized by
    `ComputeInstancePowerAction`. It builds the `spec.state` update body and the
    corresponding `updateMask` via `buildUpdateMaskPaths`, and invalidates the
    list query on success. Each row action (`Deprecate`, `Obsolete`,
    `Reactivate`) calls this one hook with its action, rather than each needing
    a separate mutation hook.
  - `useDeleteInstanceType` — delete mutation for the list page, using the
    existing `InstanceTypes.Delete` API and invalidating the list query on
    success. The delete action is rendered only for `OBSOLETE` items.


## Security and RBAC

`InstanceType` is a provider-defined resource. Write operations remain
restricted to Cloud Provider Admin users through the existing private API. This
design adds only a UI client for those existing permissions.

## Failure Handling

- List-page fetch failures should use the same pattern as other list pages: a
  non-loading error state for failed `useAdminInstanceTypes` requests. This is
  distinct from the empty-result state returned by a successful request with no
  instance types.
- Create and lifecycle-operation failures surface as a dismissible inline alert
  at the top of the page. The alert body should render the backend error
  message directly.
- Create failures use the title `Failed to create instance type`.
- Deprecation failures use the title `Failed to deprecate instance type`.
- Obsolete-transition failures use the title
  `Failed to mark instance type as obsolete`.
- Reactivation failures use the title `Failed to reactivate instance type`.
- Delete failures use the title `Failed to delete instance type`.
- Invalid create input should normally be handled by schema validation before
  the request is sent. If the backend still returns field-specific validation
  errors for `spec.cores` or `spec.memory_gib`, map them onto the matching
  `InputField` rather than surfacing them only through the top-level create
  failure alert.

## Test Plan

- Unit-test the new private API hooks.
- Unit-test the provider list and create flows, including loading, empty, and
  error states.
- Unit-test create-form validation for positive integers only, including
  rejection of decimal values for `cores` and `memory_gib`.
- Unit-test create submission to confirm validated numeric values are converted
  before building the API request and that backend field errors map to the
  matching `InputField`.
- Unit-test lifecycle state rendering and action availability for `ACTIVE`,
  `DEPRECATED`, and `OBSOLETE`.
- Unit-test lifecycle row actions so the correct update request is sent for
  `Deprecate`, `Obsolete`, and `Reactivate`.
- Unit-test that `Delete` is offered only for `OBSOLETE` items and that it
  triggers the delete mutation plus list invalidation.

No new backend or E2E coverage is required for this design.
