# PRD Author Guide

This guide explains how to write a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for
OSAC. It covers what a PRD is, how it differs from a design enhancement
proposal (EP), the personas to write for, and common mistakes to avoid.

## What is a PRD?

A PRD describes **what** the product must do and **why**, from the user's
perspective. It defines user-facing capabilities, outcomes, and success
criteria. It does not describe how the system implements those capabilities.

A PRD answers:
- Who is affected?
- What pain exists today?
- What can users do after this ships?
- How will we know it works?

## PRD vs Design EP

OSAC uses a two-stage enhancement process. The PRD comes first and defines
the requirements. The design EP follows and specifies the implementation.

| | **PRD** (`prd.md`) | **Design EP** (`design.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | Product managers, reviewers, stakeholders | Engineers, architects |
| **Focus** | User-facing capabilities and outcomes | Architecture, API fields, reconciliation logic |
| **Content** | User stories, in/out of scope, success criteria | CRD schemas, controller design, playbook parameters |
| **Lifecycle** | Merged before design work begins | Merged before implementation begins |

**Litmus test:** Could a product manager verify this by using the product?
If yes, it belongs in the PRD. If it requires reading source code, it
belongs in the design EP.

### What belongs where

| PRD (user-observable) | Design EP (implementation) |
|---|---|
| "Tenants can create persistent volumes on CaaS clusters" | CRD fields, conditions, finalizers |
| "Storage readiness is visible on the cluster status" | Controller reconcile logic |
| "Clusters are reachable without manual networking setup" | Playbook names, API schemas |
| "Admins can see storage readiness across all tenants" | Helm/installer changes |

### Platform vocabulary is not design leakage

Referencing OSAC platform terms by name is acceptable context in a PRD:

- **Platform:** OpenShift, Kubernetes, Hosted Control Planes
- **Services:** BMaaS, CaaS, VMaaS, MaaS, Enclave
- **User-facing resources:** ClusterOrder, ComputeInstance, Tenant,
  VirtualNetwork, Subnet, SecurityGroup, PublicIPPool, PublicIP,
  StorageClass
- **Tools:** kubectl, grpcurl, Helm

Naming these is fine. Mandating which internal component solves a problem
or describing controller logic is not.

### A narrow exception: illustrative examples

A single minimal example — a sample request/response shape, a short flow
list, a format a user types — may accompany prose when it's the clearest
way to convey a user-observable capability or constraint. This is not
license to describe internal architecture: apply the same litmus test to
the example as to any other statement.

- Good: "Tenants specify port mappings in the format `8080:80`
  (host:container) when creating a ComputeInstance." — a value the user
  types; conveys the format without describing the implementation.
- Bad: "The reconciler records the mapping as `conditions: [{type:
  PortMappingApplied, hostPort: 8080, containerPort: 80}]`." — reads like
  a design doc even though it's framed as an example; the condition type
  and field names are only visible in code.

Use sparingly — one example per capability, always followed by prose
stating the user-facing implication.

## OSAC Personas

Use these exact names in user stories. Every PRD should identify which
personas are affected.

| Persona | Role | Examples |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Cloud Provider Admin** | Works for the cloud provider. Handles tenant onboarding, sets quotas, manages global catalogs. Super-user who can see all tenants. | Tenant onboarding, quota management, global template catalogs |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Admin** | Works for the cloud provider. Manages core infrastructure: network, firewall, compute, storage. Integrates control plane with local infrastructure. | Network classes, IP pools, storage tiers, DNS, Netris/VAST/ESI integration |
| **Tenant Admin** | Works for the tenant organization. Manages their org's config, users, IDP, quotas, and org-specific catalogs. Can only see their own organization. | Create networking objects, manage tenant resources, onboard users |
| **Tenant User** | Works for the tenant organization. Self-service provisions cloud resources, manages full lifecycle. Prefers click-ops but wants API/CLI for automation. | Order machines/clusters/VMs, manage instance lifecycle, view quota |

Internal OSAC services (BMaaS, CaaS, VMaaS, MaaS, Enclave) are not
personas, even when a requirement is driven by one service consuming
another's capability. Describe that need in Dependencies instead — see
"Inventing a persona for an internal service" below.

## Writing Good User Stories

Use the standard formula:

> As a **{persona}**, I want **{capability}** so that **{outcome}**.

Ground each story in concrete artifacts, workflows, or scenarios. Name the
specific things users interact with.

### Good examples

- "As a Tenant User, I want to retrieve cluster kubeconfig and admin
  password via the secrets API, so that I can access my provisioned
  cluster without asking an administrator."
- "As a Cloud Infrastructure Admin, I want to configure a storage backend
  once per deployment, so that tenants get persistent storage on new
  clusters automatically."
- "As a Tenant Admin, I want to store OIDC client secrets for IDP
  integration, so that my team's identity provider credentials are
  centrally managed."
- "As a Tenant Admin or Tenant User, I want persistent storage to be
  available on my CaaS cluster when it is ready, so that I can run
  stateful workloads without waiting for manual configuration." (Two
  personas, one story — identical capability and outcome for both.)

### Bad examples

- "As a user, I want to create and manage secrets." (Too vague. Which
  secrets? SSH keypairs? OIDC credentials? Kubeconfigs? "User" is not an
  OSAC persona.)
- "As a Tenant User, I want the controller to reconcile storage within
  30 seconds." (Design leakage. Users do not observe controllers.)
- "As an admin, I want storage support." (Vague persona, vague
  capability. Which admin? What does "support" mean?)

### Tips

- One capability per story. If a story has "and", split it.
- Name the artifacts: "SSH keypairs and OIDC client secrets" not "secrets."
- State the outcome in terms of what the user can then do, not what the
  system does internally.

## Common Mistakes

### Design leakage

The most common PRD failure mode. Symptoms:

- Naming controllers, reconcilers, or finalizers
- Describing playbook parameters or AAP job templates
- Specifying internal API conditions or environment variables
- Mandating which component solves the problem

**Fix:** Describe the user-observable outcome. "Storage is automatically
available on new clusters" instead of "The storage controller invokes
osac-create-tenant-cluster-storage with provisioning_target=hcp_data_plane."

### Vague requirements

- "Storage should be available" (which clusters? what does "available"
  mean to the user?)
- "Networking should work" (which networking objects? for which services?)

**Fix:** Be specific about what users can do and see. "Tenants can create
persistent volumes using StorageClasses on their CaaS cluster within
5 minutes of the cluster becoming ready."

### Missing personas

A PRD that names no personas has an unclear audience. Every user story
must use an OSAC persona name from the table above.

### Bundling unrelated capabilities

A PRD that covers storage provisioning, networking policy enforcement,
and cluster monitoring is three features, not one. Test independence:
could each ship on its own and provide value? If yes, split them.

### Duplicated persona stories

Copying the same story under multiple persona headings just to change the
persona name inflates the document without adding information:

- "As a Tenant Admin, I want persistent storage to be available on my
  CaaS cluster when it is ready..." followed by a near-identical "As a
  Tenant User, I want persistent storage to be available on my CaaS
  cluster when it is ready..." (Same capability, same outcome — the
  duplication tells the reader nothing new.)

**Fix:** When two or more personas want the genuinely identical
capability, combine them under one heading and story: "### Tenant Admin /
Tenant User" with "As a Tenant Admin or Tenant User, I want persistent
storage to be available on my CaaS cluster when it is ready, so that I
can run stateful workloads without waiting for manual configuration."
Only combine when the capability is truly identical — if personas
experience it differently (different constraints, different visibility
scope), keep separate stories.

**The swap test:** if two persona-specific stories differ only in the
persona name and cosmetic wording — not in a constraint, scope, or
outcome actually stated in the source material — that's duplication, not
a genuine difference. Do not invent a differentiating detail (a
motivation, a downstream consumer, a constraint) that the Jira ticket or
clarification answers never mentioned, just to make two stories look
distinct enough to justify separate headings. Apply this with particular
care to Cloud Provider Admin and Cloud Infrastructure Admin — both work
for the cloud provider, which makes it tempting to invent a difference
just to keep them separate. Neither direction is automatically correct:
the persona table states cross-tenant visibility explicitly for Cloud
Provider Admin, not for Cloud Infrastructure Admin, so don't assume
identical visibility scope for both. Combine their stories only when the
source material (or the table itself) establishes a genuinely identical
capability and outcome for both; keep them separate when the source
material describes a real difference in what each can do — don't invent
a difference either way.

### Inventing a persona for an internal service

Giving an internal OSAC service its own "persona" story just because it
consumes the new capability:

- "### CaaS (Internal Service Consumer) — As the CaaS system, I want to
  read a provisioned instance's new status field so that I can correlate
  it with a registering agent." (CaaS is a service from the vocabulary
  table, not one of the four personas above — this belongs in
  Dependencies, not User Stories.)

**Fix:** Describe the service's need in Dependencies: "[Service] depends
on this metadata being present and reliable in [resource] status to
[correlate/verify/consume] X." Reserve User Stories for the personas
listed in the table above.

## Workflow

### Using the `/prd` skill (recommended)

If you are using an AI-assisted development tool (Claude Code, Cursor, or
similar), the `/prd` workflow automates PRD creation:

1. **`/prd:ingest`** with your Jira ticket to gather requirements
2. **`/prd:clarify`** to resolve ambiguities through Q&A
3. **`/prd:draft`** to generate the PRD from the template
4. **`/prd:publish`** to create a PR on enhancement-proposals

The skill produces a PRD that follows the
[prd_template.md](prd_template.md) and can be reviewed with `/prd-review`.

### Manual workflow

1. Create a directory: `mkdir enhancements/OSAC-NNNN-feature-slug/` (see
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the naming convention)
2. Copy the template: `cp guidelines/prd_template.md enhancements/OSAC-NNNN-feature-slug/prd.md`
3. Fill out all sections
4. Self-review using `/prd-review` if available, or check against the
   common mistakes above
5. Create a pull request against `main`
6. After the PRD is merged, create the design EP (`design.md`) in the
   same directory using [guidelines/design_template.md](design_template.md)
   — see [design_guide.md](design_guide.md) for authoring guidance

## Review

PRDs are reviewed against five criteria: clear user-facing need, business
justification, freedom from design leakage, focused scope, and verifiable
requirements. Use `/prd-review` for a detailed automated assessment before
submitting your PR.
